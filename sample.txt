hello everyone .This is a simple text file .
This file is meant to test the huffman encoding source code.

The compression and deccompression involves following steps

 # huffman encoding

 #-*-*-*-**-**-**-*-**-**-**-**-*  COMPRESSION *-**-**-**-**-**-**-**-**-**-*
 # step 1: calcualte the frequency of each character from the document
 # step 2: create a heap of the nodes based on the frequency
 # step 3: find the character encoding of each of the characters
 # step 4: replace the characters with the encoded format

 #-*-*-*-**-**-**-*-**-**-**-**-*  DE-COMPRESSION *-**-**-**-**-**-**-**-**-**-*
# step 1: read the bin file byte by bite
# step 2: decode each byte into espective binary notation
# step 3: extract the padding info out of the last bite added , and the remove the padded characters
# step 4: decode the text using reverse_mapping dictionary
# step 5: write the decoded string into "decompressed-"+filename+".txt"


Thank You.
